Problem Summary:
Our project is to develop a web application for a doctor who wants to consolidate all data related to patients at one place, and have an online appoinment booking system. This would benefit the doctors and the patients in several ways. However, our main client is the doctor who plans to run his own clinic. Dr. Basit, our client, wants a system that would enable patients to make appointments with the doctor beforehand. This benefits the patients a lot since they will have the ease to book an appointment from their place, without having to move physically. This benefits doctors a lot more than that. Doctors can see how many appointments they have for the day or the week etc, and then plan their activities accordingly. Other than that, our client wants that their patients' records and medical histories are consolidated at one place so that their meeting with the doctor is hassle free and the doctor has all the data they need beforehand to treat the patient.

Our app tries to incorporate the features needed by the client. To cater to the need of digitized appointment schedule, one of the features will be that the doctor can see a list of patients who have booked an appointment with them, along with the date and time of the appointment. Doctors also want prospective patients to be able to book appointments but not have a clash with other patient's appointment time either. This too will be taken care of in our application. Moreover, doctors can look up medical histories of their patients.Our
